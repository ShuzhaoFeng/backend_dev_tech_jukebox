Hi! I developed this RestAPI project using Spring Boot and Gson for my tech assignment.

To open the project, please first download the project as a `.zip` file and extract it to your local computer.

Once this is done, you have 2 options: 1-Build Maven project and run `src/main/java/project/Main.java`, or 2-run `Dockerfile`.

Once the project is running, go to `localhost:8080` and you should find detailed instructions on how to further proceed with the application.

If you don't see the instructions, please navigate to `src/main/resources/help.html` and open it to see it.


Thank you!
